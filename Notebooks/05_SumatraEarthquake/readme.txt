This is the project for
Angel, Tomy, Yongki, and Glory (with help from Tobi)

The project is based on the data and tools by Carl Tape, Univ of Fairbanks.

The project description and the solutions are in the resouce folder. 

Many of the task will be substantially simpler when using ObsPy. 
I will get in touch with Carl Tape to get the matlab scripts. 

Tasks: 
- run the matlab scripts and verify the solutions
- convert the tasks using ObsPy (Tobi will help)
- turn the problems into (several) Jupyter notebooks
