This is the project for Kilian:

- Follow the maths and general implementation of the Tarantola IASPEI paper I gave you
- Notebook should contain some fundamentals of probabilistic inversion (posterior = prior times likelihood from experiment)
- Start simple ... follow the matlab-python converted script. 
- There might be ways to make the codes more readible eg through functions
- Please add all source material in subfolders
